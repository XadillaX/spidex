Install
-------

```sh
$ npm install spidex
```

Usage
-----

You just need to get the handler:

```javascript
var spidex = require("spidex");
```

> After v2.0.0, spidex uses new APIs.

And the functions are:

```javascript
spidex.get(url, [opts], [callback]);
spidex.post(url, [opts], [callback]);
spidex.put(url, [opts], [callback]);
spidex.delete(url, [opts], [callback]);
```

`opts` can be an `Object` that has options follow:

+ `data`: the body data. it may be a querystring or a JSON object.
+ `header`: customized request header.
+ `charset`: "utf8", "gbk", "big5" or other encodings `iconv-lite` supported. what's more, it supports "binary" now.
+ `timeout`: set the totally timeout millionsecond.
+ `responseTimeout`: set the response timeout millionsecond.
+ `requestTimeout`: set the request timeout millionsecond.

There's a helper function:

```javascript
spidex.parseCookie(responseHeaders);
```

And two `user-agent` functions:

```javascript
spidex.setDefaultUserAgent(userAgent);
spidex.getDefaultUserAgent();
```

You can go through `test/spidex.js` for further examples.
